# 📊 LeetCode SQL 50 — My Solutions

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains my personal solutions to the **SQL 50** problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/). It's part of my ongoing journey to get better at writing clean, efficient SQL queries and improve my skills.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I created this repo to:
- Practice solving real-world SQL problems
- Build a solid foundation in SQL for data-related roles
- Track my progress and have a place to review my past solutions
- Share my thought process with others who are also learning

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

Each solution is written in standard SQL (Postgre SQL) and organized by problem number and title. Whenever possible, I include comments to explain what each part of the query does.

✅ Some queries are optimized for readability, others for performance.  
💡 I'm constantly updating solutions as I learn better ways to solve them.

## 🚀 Goals

- Finish all 50 SQL problems
- Refactor solutions when I learn better techniques
- Possibly include PostgreSQL versions in the future
